<p style="font-size: 18px;">The biggest and most commercially successful thrash metal band, and one of, if not the, most popular metal bands of all time, Metallica's domination over heavy metal spanned over a decade and incorporated numerous genres. From their beginnings with their punk-influenced debut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nlcn0_w1LrpfebiNwWFcxr9m1oHb2aacg">Kill 'Em All</a>, to the more melodic and refined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mOdQxz7jo68Aq_KjOqpBbjJ1L8UnuN6CU">Ride the Lightning</a> (which saw them beginning to experiment with power ballads in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdWw9SksiwQ">Fade to Black</a>), to what was undoubtedly the most infleuntial thrash metal album of all time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lHtcjdo7MU4A3Tt3MuErEdEOOqs4UgngE">Master of Puppets</a>, even to a more commercial yet nonetheless powerful shift in sound via their selftitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lC7x9GRfczCwtX2tGWY-Fy3wYXTGqsGxQ">Metallica (the Black Album)</a>, Metallica have proven themselves to be a very versatile and technically proficient band. They were always willing to experiment with many different sounds, including many bass-prominent instrumentals, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctSru6Cw6s">Orion</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfGMinbSVI8">the Call of Ktulu</a> and Cliff Burton's greatest bass solo, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhFMMiTmHb4">Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)</a>.</p>
