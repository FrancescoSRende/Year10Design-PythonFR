<p style="font-size: 18px;">Finland's most popular exporter of melodic death metal, Children of Bodom are one of the most popular extreme metal bands in the world. Formed in 1993 as Inearthed, the band changed their name to Children of Bodom in 1997. The name was derived from Lake Bodom, a lake in Finland where a series of unsolved murders took place. Shortly after this name change, they released their first album, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lTBk6uMDolHAX_qYr6bwEqKVVs47JiOoc">Something Wild</a>, which was critically acclaimed by metal press and presented an interesting fusion of melodic death metal, black metal and neoclassical. They continued this rise to fame with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lr6X_Ipy7qHqmpgb1YXqAD0lW7jGfWjX4">Hatebreeder</a>, released in 1999 to more acclaim. This album also spawned one of their most famous singles, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW62WKwVTM4">Downfall</a>.</p>
