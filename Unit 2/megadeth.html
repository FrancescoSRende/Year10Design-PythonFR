<p style="font-size: 18px;">One of the big four thrash metal bands of the 80s and 90s, Megadeth was arguably the most technically proficient of their peers, often incorporating long, shred-based and neoclassical-influenced solos. A perfect example of this is their fourth album, and arguably their most famous one, the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kM-tYdluxoeUZx_GhwaXXZdK38qXFarjU">Rust In Peace</a>. The album boasted the famous and infinitely catchy riffs of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d4ui9q7eDM">Holy Wars... the Punishment Due</a>, their most famous solo from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sONL6QUMR9E">Tornado of Souls</a> and the seemingly endless long solo battles of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5A9Aa-WU5E">Hangar 18</a>. But this was merely the culmination of work that had begun three albums prior, with their debut album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ld61D6v9_mNg5m3dptD0l47afHYgyS9O4">Killing is My Business...And Business Is Good!</a>. The album presented the same kinds of difficult, technically challenging riffs and solos that would become the norm on Rust In Peace. A perfect example of this is their debut song, one of the strongest album and band openers of all time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzs5wUXHCPs">Last Rites/Loved to Deth</a>.</p>
